# "Our Story"

The creation of Forge Fitness was not a planned thing. It all started when Brian was asked by some friends to teach them how to 'lift'. At the time, his 300sf cluttered garage had some really crappy equipment; but it worked. After a few times, he reached out to a long time friend who ended up bringing along a handful of his friends; and we both started teaching basic strength & conditioning to them all. As time passed, we slowly grew from 3-4 people into having 7-9+ people come by and workout many times a week! At this point, we knew we had to find a bigger space.

At our new space, we hold true the things that got us started. We are a gym that is designed to help those who have never done what we do before. Everyone is a beginner at some point in their life and it's those people that we attract. The folks with that beginner mindset are the ones that always want to learn, and it's those people that will stay for the long haul. Our gym and our community is a single community. It is not broken down into the AM/PM class or the Guys/Girls or any other 'clique' we are not in middle school anymore. Above all, is acceptance. No matter someone's age, weight, strength or anything else; we welcome with open arms.

## Mission Statement

Forge Fitness was born out of strength athletes who knew that proper movement proceeds the weight on the bar and that the pursuit of strength will make all other aspects of fitness and life easier. Forge Fitness is a gym that is designed for beginners to feel comfortable. Forge Fitness is a gym that breeds the ever-learning mindset. No matter how long you've been working towards your fitness goals, one who approaches this world with an open mindset is the one who will get the most out of our facility, our coaches and our community.

## Owner's Intent

As owners, we have two main principles that all our staff should keep fresh in their minds with respect to our clients and potential clients. First, we want our folks to move safely in a way that will not only make them stronger but allow them to come back tomorrow and the next day. Secondly, we want our folks to feel comfortable in our gym and in their own skin.

Welcome to the Forge Fitness team!

If you've made it this far, be proud; you've clearly established yourself as an outstanding member of the Fitness community. At Forge Fitness there are only a few simple rules of conduct, most of which are common sense; others will help you improve your relationship with clientele, other staff, and the outside world at large. Some, whose purpose may not be obvious at first, will reveal their own benefits as you become more accustomed to the atmosphere at Forge Fitness.

Within this manual, you'll see how we operate. You'll be given in-depth detail about each rule as you go along. These are simple (but essential) things that separate Forge Fitness from the rest of the herd; they're not day-to-day maintenance, but rather insurance of a positive attitude and environment for clients, guests, and staff. This stuff is not hard, though it will require some practice. You'll also see the more mundane (but absolutely necessary) everyday rules of operation for Forge Fitness facilities and staff. They're simple, and easy to remember if you practice them daily. Miss one, though, or become routinely sloppy with them, and it hurts the entire atmosphere for everyone.

You'll be given an employee review after your first month, your third month, and then semi-annually from that point onward. There's a blank review attached, as well as some personal goal-setting sheets that you'll go through as part of your orientation process.

As you'll see in our philosophy, Forge Fitness isn't a facility; it's a team approach to fitness, exercise, mobility, and health. We strive to have the best resources in Rochester, NY and will always be looking for a larger more in-depth network. Our network outside the physical facility includes a solid relationship with all chiropractors, physiotherapy clinics, doctors, and other health professionals; work hard to maintain and groom that relationship!

## A Brief History of Everything

We have dozens of little quirks here at Forge Fitness; some of them, you may find challenging; some of them, you may wonder at their logic. However, rest assured that every single policy and idea in this book has been formed through extensive research, trial and error, and (often) painful experience.

FITNESS TRAINING / COACHING is a flat market. That means that, despite all our research, study, long hours and hard work, the client really only differentiates personal trainers according to one solitary factor: their relationship with the trainer. That's right: regardless of client progress, regardless of results gained from the training, or experience of the trainer, client retention is 90% dependent on the relationship of the trainer with the client. It may be tough to remember to turn on the stereo system in the morning. You may struggle to remember to pick up your client's empty water bottle after several hours of training in a row. You may not want to write a nice postcard to the client you just met at 5pm on Friday afternoon. You probably won't feel like running to retrieve a weight for a client. But the client will never remember the last study you
---
quoted her; she'll remember you running to retrieve a weight so she doesn't have to stare at the walls while you're moseying around. These lessons have been hard-won. But without them, to the client at least, we're just like everyone else, yuck!.

No matter what else happens, we will never be outworked. Never will a client leave Forge Fitness for a competitor because we're too lazy: this, above all, is the original sin.

## New Team members – benefits and responsibilities

1. As a Team member, you are absolutely required, without exception, to meet Forge Fitness's dress code requirements whenever leading a group, training a client, at the front desk, or otherwise performing Forge Fitness duties, including public speaking. If you arrive for work without your uniform, you are REQUIRED to purchase clothing suitable for your duties that day. It is suggested you leave a shirt at the gym that is solely for coaching in.

2. You will be provided with a comprehensive guide for your performance (this guide.) You will be asked to initial the form at the end of this guide to acknowledge that you've read and you understand everything within. As soon as you initial that form, you're responsible for upholding the contents of this book 100%.

3. You will have access to all Forge Fitness Team members at the lowest cost possible – the Team member's invoice rate. When a Team member takes their time to provide you with a professional service, they deserve the same compensation they would receive from a client. However, Forge Fitness doesn't have to make its share; we believe the long-term benefit of your health and exposure to other Team members is enough. One note: please book appointments with other Team members at a time when they're not normally busy to avoid inconveniencing Forge Fitness clients. (An example of this would be if you book a PT session with someone in order to learn one of their skills for yourself or to better yourself as a coach.)

4. You have a responsibility to Forge Fitness and its clients to act in their best interests at all times. Forge Fitness has a responsibility to all Team members to act in the best interests of the group, to ensure that all continue to thrive.

   a. Sign into Zen Planner - You will be provided with the required credentials
   b. Click 'people'
   c. Click 'Add person'
      i. Go through the required steps on the screen
---
## Cancelling Appointments – EMERGENCY SITUATIONS

1. Notify the Head Trainer as early as possible.
2. Call the clients personally, or make sure that the Head Trainer is prepared to do so. Provide names and phone numbers.
3. If time permits, print out the last workout given to the client, and suggest updates to the Trainer taking your spot.
4. On the next appointment with the client, apologize again and ask if they were satisfied with the replacement and/or schedule changes.

## Cancelling Appointments – Client

1. It is Forge Fitness's policy that cancellations must be made by 8am on the day of the appointment, or are subject to full billing. This must be made clear at the time of the initial consultation.
2. Mistakes happen. At the Head Trainer's discretion, clients may be issued a warning the first time they cancel late.
   a. Sample script: "Thanks for the call. I won't charge you for the session since this is the first time you've cancelled, but I'd like to remind you that our policy IS to charge full rate for sessions cancelled after 8am. Please call before 8am next time to avoid a charge." (Feel free to personalize that but that's the gist)
3. In some serious situations, the Head Trainer may waive the fee (drastic circumstances, not including personal illness.)

## Background on cancellation policy:

Most Personal Training facilities operate on a 24-hour no-cancellation policy, and rigidly enforce it. Their argument is that the client OWNS the time slot, and therefore it's their responsibility to arrive on time (or at all.) We realize that, to maintain a positive, humanistic relationship with clients, we need to be flexible; hence the 8am cancellation policy.

Essentially, by 8am, if you're sick, you'll know it. If your child is staying home sick, you'll know it by 8am (but you may not know it the night before!) If you're snowed under, you'll know it by 8am, etc.
---
# Performing Consultations

1. Be ready 10 minutes before the consultation is to begin.
2. Greet the client at the door, and invite them in.
3. Start with the client's background and goals; listen patiently, asking prompting questions, until the client is absolutely finished. "You have 2 ears and 1 mouth, listen twice as much as you speak"
4. Clearly delineate goals on the client's intake form; make thorough notes.
5. Offer the client a tour before suggesting possible paths to achieve success.
6. Present the client with various options to help them succeed.
   i. a) 1 on 1 personal training
   ii. b) CrossFit Classes
   iii. c) QuikFit Classes

7. Book the client an appointment with the appropriate trainer to complete their physical assessment (see: booking appointments.)
8. Immediately following the departure of the client, email a Welcome message (ex. "You're On Your Way Up!") personalized with a message from the trainer to the client.
9. Create a file comprising of the following (New document in Google Drive)
   a. health history/personal inventory
   b. goals sheet
   c. other client data

## Personal Training First Visit:
1. General Assessment and Testing
2. Introduce the client to the other staff member and other members.

# Checking and Responding to Email

1. If you're using the computer, check the Forge Fitness email account every hour (minimum).
2. Respond to every email using the Forge Fitness email account. DO NOT use your own account to communicate with clients or other staff members for anything to do with Forge Fitness. This way, you have a tracking system for all your communications in case of dispute.
3. If you read an email intended for another trainer, leave as unread and make a note at the desk.
4. Respond to emails immediately; do NOT procrastinate. If you lack information, flag the message for follow-up and find the information as quickly as possible.
a) Respond to your own email within 3 hours of receipt. If necessary, respond that you are waiting on information before providing a full response. However, send an email acknowledging receipt of the client's email.

## Ordering Shirts, Supplements

Forge Fitness carries its own line of apparel (shirts, sweats) and a few lines of nutritional supplements. It is the responsibility of the Marketing Manager to maintain the stock levels of supplements, logo items, and apparel.

## STAFF PURCHASES

Staff are entitled to purchase goods and services at Forge Fitness's cost. That includes services from other Team members, as applicable.

## SUPPLEMENTS

Staff may purchase supplements at wholesale cost. The staff member should inquire from the General Manager before purchase. Purchase of supplements are subject to TAXES. However, purchases of supplements by staff members count toward applicable revenue targets.

## STAFF-STAFF SERVICES

Being fit and athletic, Trainers and other staff may occasionally require the services of another Team member. Forge Fitness highly recommends periodically training with other Trainers to continually progress in your Training skills. Since we all benefit indirectly, Forge Fitness requires only that the Team member using the service pay the Team member providing the service at their own session rate. For instance, when using the services of another Contractor, the Team member would pay the normal rate paid by Forge Fitness to that contractor. When using the services of a Team member who's leasing space from Forge Fitness, their normal rates apply, as do TAXES. Any transactions are to be handled between Team members. If the Forge Fitness debit machine is used, then the full Forge Fitness rate is to be charged, plus any applicable taxes.

Examples: Mary wants to get Physio from Bill, the Team physiotherapist. Normally, Forge Fitness would charge $45 for this service, and Bill would invoice Forge Fitness $25. In this case, Mary would pay Bill $25 in cash or cheque. If Mary uses the Forge Fitness debit machine, the full $45 rate applies (plus TAXES). Another example: Bill wants to use Mary's Massage Therapist skills to relieve lower back tightness. Since Mary is not a subcontractor but a lessee, her full rate applies, plus taxes. Bill may pay in any method he chooses.

## Performing a One-On-One Personal Training Session

1. Before the session begins, make sure your work area is ready:
   a. Weights required are available in your space;
   b. Your space is tidy;
   c. Coordinate workout space needed with other trainers.
2. Be ready to greet the client 15 minutes before the scheduled start time, unless catering to another client immediately beforehand.
3. Administer a brief warm-up. During the warm-up period maintain a friendly banter.
---
4. Administer program.
5. Stretch and review program with client as necessary.
6. With 2 minutes remaining in the hour, finish the workout and begin tidying the space to make sure it's ready for the next trainer/client:
   a. sweep up chalk;
   b. remove all garbage;
   c. return plates, bars, and dumbbells etc, to proper space;
   d. move belts and bands to the correct space.
   e. Mop up sweat.
7. Greet the next client and begin their warm-up.

## Writing A Training Program

1. Familiarize yourself with the client. Establish 'Point A', using the client's historical workouts, periodization plan, or physical assessment, depending on how new the client is.
2. Establish the timeframe for which the program is to be utilized. As a rule of thumb, consider the performance criteria a client should be able to meet at the end of the program you are about to write.
3. Work backward from the short-term criteria you expect the client to meet as a result of this mesocycle. Which exercises will get them there?
4. Consider like clients in similar stages of progress.
5. Tailor for individual needs first, and then:
6. Tailor for individual preferences.

# THE CRITICAL LIST

These logical rules are what makes Forge Fitness different from every gym, personal training facility, and other fitness facility around. These rules are really what make us successful, and are a big part of the reason we're constantly growing while many others in our field falter.

1. Do What You Say You Will Do.
2. 10-foot rule.
3. When retrieving something, run.
4. Don't present a problem without a proposed solution.
5. Call Back within 4 Hours.
6. The Answer is Always Yes.
7. Carry In, Carry Out.
8. Back Office appropriate behaviour
9. Front Office appropriate behaviour
10. Cleaning Schedule
11. Booking Consultations
12. Group Signup Procedure
13. Selling Tshirts and Supplements
14. Garbage locations and responsibilities
15. Smile on the phone.
16. See it from the client's perspective first.
17. If you can't put forth your best effort, don't do it.
18. Create a positive environment.

# THE ESSENTIAL LIST

These things are rules that should be automatic, but may be hard to remember during a busy period. Nevertheless, they are just as important Saturday night as Monday morning. While clients will never complain about any of the things below, they are a huge part of a potential client's decision to return, and also affect your relationship with other staff and the Management Team.

1. Keep your area clean. Replace all equipment at the end of a session. Place equipment back in the proper location. Clean white board 100%. At the end of the day, the facility should be 100% ready for the first client of the next day.
2. After every consultation, fill out a 'You're On Your Way Up!' email, and send it THAT DAY.
3. At the start of your shift:
   1. Turn on all lights.
   2. Turn on sound system.
4. At the end of your shift:
   1. Turn off lights.
---
2. Take your lunch and workout gear with you or pack it away in your cubby.
3. Lock ALL doors.

## How to deal with injuries:

### Level 1 Injuries

1. Callus Rip: Give them a paper towel to help stop bleeding. Give them a lysol wipe to clean up anything that has blood on it. Give them a bandage & have them sign injury report form.
2. Shin cut (missed box jump, deadlift/cleaning etc..) - Same procedure as Callus Rip.
3. Any other small cut or scrape where bleeding & pain is minimal.

### Level 2 injuries

1. Large cuts that may require hospital visit and/or stitches. Stop class. Elevate affected area above the heart and give them paper towels to stop/slow down bleeding. Ask if they want to be picked up by a friend/family member and taken to the Dr or if someone from class is willing to. Have them sign injury report form. Once they are on their way, clean up any blood/bodily fluids and resume class.

2. If someone falls off the rig and hits their head; but bleeding isn't present, make sure they stay awake and remove them from the workout. Check on them periodically. Have them fill out injury report form.

3. Other L2 injuries could be a twisted ankle, a broken bone or if someone hurts their back badly. Any/all of these will be treated as follows:
   a. Remove them from WOD.
   b. Ice the area if PAINFUL
   c. Elevate the affected area
   d. Determine if they are able to make the proper decision about what to do next. I.E. If they are too busy passed out or bleeding; you make the call.

# Strategic Advantages - Forge Fitness

- Our attitude.
- Small Class Size (12)
- Small Membership Base (under 50!)
- Stratified Pricing - Only Pay for what you want
- Tucked away but close by

"With well over 15 great CrossFit boxes in the Rochester area, what makes CrossFit Chili stand out so much?"

Our biggest differentiator has to be our complete caring of everyone who walking in our doors. We've had handfuls of people comment on how we really and genuinely care for how our members are moving, feeling and progressing. Our personal touch is what keeps our clients happy and coming back.

We've always done everything in our power to keep our classes small and intimate. In October 2015; after over 2yrs of operating, we're only not going from 10 to 12 people capped in a normal CrossFit class. Thankfully we have the space, equipment and coaching to easily handle that minor change. Also, our gym is still small, from a membership point of view. At the time of writing this, we're still under the 50 person marker. So, people really know one another pretty well. It's nice; as a coach and owner, because I never feel like I need to always lead the conversation because we are all friends.

One other thing that is a bit outside the norm when it comes to CrossFit is that we use a 'Stratified Pricing' model. This is sort of like an 'Ala Carte' Fitness Menu. You can pick and choose from a list of offerings and only pay for what you want; and nothing else. It just makes sense. When you go to the buffet; why wouldn't you want to be able to get what you want and leave all the other things that don't interest you for someone else?

Lastly, our location is pretty cool. It's out in the woods to some degree. We are tucked away but also 3/4mi from Jefferson Road and a stone's throw away from RIT. Lots of us are RIT Alumni so that's nice to be nearby!

# Coaching Advancement Program (CAP) at Forge Fitness:

The goal of this program is to give willing participants a view of what it is like to be a coach at our facility.

Participant shall meet with coach 5-10 min prior in order to discuss the day's class as well as be available for 5-10 min afterwards to review. This first month, the participant is not to do any coaching of the members. Their job for this first month is to watch and listen to the coach, and make connections with the incoming members.
